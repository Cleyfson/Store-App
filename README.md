# Store App
 
The idea behind the program is to simulate taking orders from a restaurant that sells through an app. Orders consist of a list of products and a delivery address. The "pedido" tag indicates the beginning of a new order and the "endereco" tag indicates the end of the order. Each product is represented by two lines. The first line informs the product type and the second line informs the product attributes.

Input example:
pedido
Pizza
Pepperoni,4,1,2,40
hamburger
X-everything,1,2,25
endereco
Rua Maria Luiza Santiago 200 - Santa Lucia, Belo Horizonte - MG
